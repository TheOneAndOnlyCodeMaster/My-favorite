        <h1> Drawing
        </h1>
        <h3> I like to draw many things, but I mainly like to draw superheroes, cartoons, or random things you probably wouldn't think of. Like tomatoe soup cans, or a pile of cards, or a dancing moon banana getting wierd looks from a mountain that looks like a colorful wolf getting barfed on with rainbows by a cloud. Weren't expecting that, were you?

        <h1> Reading
        </h1>
        <h3> I like reading, and everybody should. Mainly comedy and action, but sometimes I like mystery. My favorite book series is probably Diary of a Wimpy Kid, but my favorite books include; the trilogy of Popularmmos books, and well, it's kinda hard to remember all of my favoritee titles, but I think that's a pretty good amount of boks. (boks indeed...)

        <h2> Here are some of my inspirations:</h2>
        <h4> One of my inspirations is my 6th grade art teacher. His techniques and work gave me somthing to look up to, and taught me creativity. Another one of my inspirations is Leonardo da Vinci. And one more includes myself, one day I was sitting, watching TV, but I got bored, so I drew something, and that started a spark.</h4>
